Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks. 
It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services.
Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. 
Starting with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.
