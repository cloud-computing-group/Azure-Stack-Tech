Microsoft Azure Stack is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver Azure services from your organizationâ€™s datacenter. Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview 3 is being made available as a Proof of Concept (POC). Once deployed, the POC is an ideal environment for learning and demonstrating Azure Stack features. It lets you deploy all required components on a single physical machine to create an environment for evaluating key concepts and capabilities, and validating the extensibility model for APIs.

Scope of Azure Stack POC
Azure Stack POC must not be used as a production environment and should only be used for testing, evaluation, and demonstration.
Your deployment of Azure Stack is associated with a single identity provider, like Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services. You can create multiple users in this directory and assign subscriptions to each user.
With all components deployed on the single machine, there are limited physical resources available for tenant resources. This configuration is not intended for scale or performance evaluation.
Networking scenarios are limited due to the single host/NIC requirement.
