    Azure Stack. In a nutshell, Azure Stack is your own private instance of Azure in a box that you can run in your on-premises datacenter.

    The hybrid cloud:
    The hybrid cloud model is, as its name implies, a mixture between the public and the private cloud. You can use public cloud services that use resources in your private cloud, and vice versa. In Azure, you could run an application in an Azure Web App that connects to an on-premises database using Azure Hybrid Connections.

    Three main cloud computing types:
    SaaS, (LaaS), PaaS, IaaS.
    With IaaS, you are responsible for everything, except the hardware. Example: Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Virtual Networks, and Azure Containers.
    PaaS example: Azure App Service, Azure SQL Databases, and Azure Redis Cache.
